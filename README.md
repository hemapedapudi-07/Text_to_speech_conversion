# Text_to_speech_conversion
Text to speech conversion for blind using BiLSTM and RNN.
The main goal of this project is to give a novel approach to text detection and text recognition based on 
Deep Neural Networks and bidirectional LSTM. For conversion of text to audio, a Python package pytts 3 
is considered. With the help of a speaker, the speech transformed text will be supplied as an output to 
blind people. SVHN dataset, SVT dataset are used in this paper. By using the above algorithm, the 
performance and accuracy of the mentioned model will be more efficient and accurate.
